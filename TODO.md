## Gameplan for Stage 1:
- [x] Remove old code
- [x] Create internal variables for the local player (HP, maxHP, AC, conditions)
- [ ] Access the SD card programmatically [Demo is checked off]
- [ ] Create logic to change internal variables
- [ ] Pull in command line interface
- [ 1/3 ] Pull in UI setup
- [ 1/3 ] Attach logic to screen   (Create CRUD functions and let the screen do the work?)

- [ ] Add in main screen

- [ ] Access the SD card in real life
- [x] Get display to work
- [x] Get touchscreen to work

Should I include the Event Loop library?
Since nothing else is happening, I may not need to pin the UI task, but it may be good practice
