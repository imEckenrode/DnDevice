CREATING EVENTS:

To create an event to use with the Event Loop Library, use the standard ESP32 method of defining events.

    ESP_EVENT_DECLARE_BASE(BASENAME_BASE);      (in .h file)
    ESP_EVENT_DEFINE_BASE(BASENAME_BASE);    (in .c file)

IN ADDITION, any base using dndv_comms requires a second step to properly utilize ESP-NOW's limited size:
To save space, each base must have a unique number key between 0-255. 
These numbers are assigned through the init.c function DNDV_EBD_DEFINE(and the event bases go here in a comma separated list), with the order corresponding to the ID number
